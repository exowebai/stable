                    <h4>WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT ?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Exoplanets, these celestial bodies orbiting stars beyond our solar system, have become a major subject of study due to their immense potential. 
                        Indeed, the possibility of the existence of habitable planets just like ours allowed for extensive research in the hopes of better understanding
                        the world that we live in and how it functions.  
                        <br><br>
                        Up until today there have been numerous discoveries of exoplanet candidates, using various techniques to detect them, such as measuring the slight changes in the brightness
                        of the stars they orbit around for when they pass in front of it, or even detecting the movement patterns of the star due to the gravitational interactions around it.

                        Driven by this big interest in studying the possibilities of life on other planets, this project hopes to 
                        help this cause, by organising, processing and classifying incoming data from telescopes all around the world, and then broadcasting it to the entire network. 
                        This way, we can safely analyse and identify possible exoplanets with better efficiency and accuracy, as well as allow for scientists across the globe to connect and share their discoveries.

                    <h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
                    <h4>HOW EXACTLY DOES IT WORK ?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Our web application is designed to assist the astronomy community in the detection and classification of exoplanets using Semi-Supervised Machine Learning. 
                        Users are required to provide the relevant data pertaining to the planet they wish to classify. Subsequently, our application will categorize their planet into one of the following classes: confirmed, candidate, or false positive.
                        <br><br>
                        Our system encompasses three primary functions : 
                        <ol>
                            <li><span>Classification :</span> We receive unlabeled data collected from telescope sensors and sent by the clients, preprocess it, and apply our machine learning model to make predictions. This process generates pseudo-labeled data, which is then stored in the central server. </li>
                            <li><span>Retraining :</span> In this project, we leverage Semi-Supervised Machine Learning, meaning that our model continuously learns and retrains itself. Initially, the model is trained on the original data, and subsequently, it undergoes further training using data from the network's public dataset. </li>
                            <li><span>Data Collection and Storage :</span> Our distributed framework connects various clients (observatories) to the central server. The unlabeled data received after classification is subsequently stored in the network's public dataset and utilized in the retraining of the model.</li>
                        </ol>
